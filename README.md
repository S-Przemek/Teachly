Teachly — Graduation Project  
Higher Diploma in Science in Computing (Software / Web Development)  
National College of Ireland

## Project overview

Teachly is a web-based application developed as a final-year graduation project for the Higher Diploma in Science in Computing (Software/Web Development) at the National College of Ireland.

The core idea of Teachly is to be an educational platform where students can learn directly from teachers via a streaming service provided by the platform (live, interactive sessions), rather than only through pre-recorded online courses. Teachly focuses on real-time teaching features: live video streaming, scheduled classes, interactive chat/Q&A, and session recording for later review.

This project is implemented using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). Replace any example commands or placeholders below with the exact scripts and values used in your repository.

## Key goals and objectives

- Implement a functional, secure, and responsive web application demonstrating full‑stack development skills.
- Provide real-time, interactive learning experiences through teacher-hosted live streams.
- Cover core capabilities: user authentication & authorization, course/session management, assignment creation/submission, live streaming and recordings, and basic reporting.
- Follow best practices for testing, version control, and deployment.
- Produce documentation and code suitable for demonstration and assessment.

## Features

- User roles: Admin, Teacher, Student
- Live streaming for scheduled classes (teacher-hosted sessions)
